# C++ Module Projects

This repository contains a series of C++ modules (cpp05 through cpp09) that demonstrate various aspects of C++ programming. Each module consists of multiple exercises that focus on specific programming concepts and techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into five main modules:

### Module 05
- **ex00**: Introduction to exceptions and error handling
- **ex01**: Implementation of custom exception classes
- **ex02**: Advanced exception handling and resource management
- **ex03**: Complex exception handling scenarios

### Module 06
- **ex00**: Type casting and conversion operators
- **ex01**: Serialization and deserialization
- **ex02**: Advanced type casting and dynamic casting

### Module 07
- **ex00**: Template programming basics
- **ex01**: Template specialization
- **ex02**: Advanced template metaprogramming

### Module 08
- **ex00**: STL containers and algorithms
- **ex01**: Custom container implementations
- **ex02**: Advanced STL usage and custom iterators

### Module 09
- **ex00**: Smart pointers and memory management
- **ex01**: Custom smart pointer implementation
- **ex02**: Advanced memory management techniques

## Building and Running

Each exercise can be built independently. Navigate to the specific exercise directory and use the following commands:

```bash
make
./program_name
```

## Requirements

- C++ compiler supporting C++98 standard
- Make utility
- Standard C++ libraries

## Notes

- Each module builds upon the concepts learned in previous modules
- Exercises are designed to be completed in order
- Code follows C++98 standard requirements
- Each exercise includes its own Makefile for building
